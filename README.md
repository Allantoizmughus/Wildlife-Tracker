This project is a website whose function is to help rangers identify and record all wild animals in the Fir forest in order to enhance conservation.

The website is operational and all its functionalities are working well. These are functions like display all recorded animals, displaying all sites that the animals were spotted at, adding a new animal in the list, adding a new sighting in the list of sighting.
